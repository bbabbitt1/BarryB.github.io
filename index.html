								<h2 class ="content">A Tale of Two Grips: An A/B Test on Putting Performance</h2>
								<span class ="image main"><img src= "https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1325834105/photo/the-john-shippen-national-invitational-day-2.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=gi&k=20&c=_Th_tCDcyfnSJsaX8GIDNlM2k6gtLNclP5WQFj7VrcQ=" alt ="" /></span>
								<p> As a former professional golfer and passionate analyst, I undertook an intriguing project to settle a question I have had for years: Is there a statistical difference between using a conventional putting grip and a crosshanded grip? To answer this question for myself, I designed a formalized statistical A/B test, employing rigorous data collection and analysis techniques. </p>
								<h3 class = "content"> Data Collection: Independence & Randomization</h3>
								<p>To ensure independence between the two putting grips, I carefully considered a diverse set of approaches. I still wanted to maintain a level of control, and thus, chose two lengths to base my analysis: 8 feet and 20 feet, representing common PGA Tour benchmarks for putting performance. I hit 20 putts from each length, where the order of the 40 putts was randomized using Excel's number generator.</p>
								<p>To randomly select 8 feet or 20 feet for each putt, use the following formula in cell B2:</p>
								<p>=RANDBETWEEN(1, 2)</p>
								<p>Then, in cells B3 to B41, use the following formula to ensure that each length putt is hit 20 times:</p>
								<p>=IF(COUNTIF($B$2:B2, 2)=20, 1, RANDBETWEEN(1, 2))</p>
								<p>Additionally, hole selection and putt positions (based on clock system) were randomized to prevent any preference bias.</p>
								<h3 class = "content">Exploration & Descriptive Statistics</h3>
								<p> After data collection, I explored the results an calculated descriptive statistics using both Excel and Python for both grip styles at each putt length. The data revealed an interesting pattern: from 20 feet, the daily average makes for crosshanded putts(3.8) surpassed conventional putts (2.7), hinting at a potential difference with real-world implications.</p>
								<h3 class = "content">Hypothesis Testing: Analyzing the Difference </h3>
								<p>To establish, statistical significance, I used two-sample mean T-tests and two-sample proportion tests for both 8 and 20 foot putts. While the initial tests did not reveal a significant difference between the two grips, a closer look suggested a possibility of significance at a more lenient threshold. Below is a cell of python code used to run one of the tests.</p>

								<h3 class = "content">Limitations & Future Directions </h3>
								<p>While the results did not conclusively prove a stastical difference, this project sets the stage for deeper exploration and continued observation. Future investigations, could explore additional metrics such as aim, target, and speed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the grip impact. Furthermore, analyzing face rotation and arc with different putter types could provide valuable insights.</p>

								<h2 class="content">Cyclistic Bike Share</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/3001171/5164254/17d885e47adada77f6fd49ad1313b670/dataset-cover.png?t=2023-03-14-11-22-28" alt="" /></span>
								<p> In the Google Data Analyst Certificate, I selected the case study "Cyclistic Bike Share" as my Capstone project. As a junior data analyst, I worked in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. The primary objective was to maximize the number of annual memberships, as the director of marketing believed it was crucial for the company's future success. To achieve this, I aimed to uncover the key differences in the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members. </p>
								<p> To initiate the project, I exported 12 months of data from the company database, unzipped the files, and uploaded them to BigQuery. The first step was data cleaning, where I combined all 12 months of data using UNION and checked for any inconsistencies. I ensured that the IDs shared a common length and format, searched for empty rows, and removed any duplicate data. Additionally, I discovered empty cells in the end-station ID column, which I communicated to the marketing team, as they planned to place advertisements at the ending locations. </p>
								<p> Continuing with the data cleaning process, I manipulated the date columns to obtain ride duration data. Understanding the correlation between membership type and the time spent during a bike ride was important for potential strategies to incentivize casual riders, such as introducing a points system for hours spent on the bike for members. I also derived weekdays and months from the initial date columns for further analysis. As an added analysis, I introduced a peak month column to serve as a filter for data visualization, considering Chicago's weather influence on bike ride activity. To determine peak months, I used a CASE statement in SQL, identifying months in the top 50% of total rides, which could provide insights for seasonal membership activity and advertising approaches.</p>
								<p> To conclude the data cleaning process, I addressed data points that heavily skewed the information, such as bike rides registered for over 24 hours. For the purpose of this project, I limited rides to 6 hours or less to observe membership behavior on a per-ride basis. I selected 6 hours based on travel time across Chicago using Google Maps.</p>
								<p> After the data was cleaned and manipulated, I utilized Tableau to build visualizations. I started with a clear KPI banner to illustrate key statistics from the data, providing context to the remaining visuals. The dashboard focused on membership activity on a per-weekday basis and bike type used.</p>
								<p> The ultimate goal of the visualization was to show the marketing team the behavior of members versus casual users. Based on the insights gained, I recommended three actionable takeaways:</p>	
								<p> 1.	Introduce a rewards program where hours served as points. Since casual riders ride longer on average, time incentives might encourage them to consider membership.</p>
								<p> 2.	Offer seasonal memberships. Casual user activity significantly increases during peak months, making it an opportune time to introduce membership packages at the right price point.</p>
								<p> 3.	Introduce a "Weekend Warrior Membership" package. As casual riders are more active on weekends, this package could be appealing to those who only ride on weekends, and it could be complemented with the overall rewards program</p>
								<p> One primary limitation of working with this data was the lack of knowledge about pricing. Pricing plays a significant role in influencing decisions, so without information about member price points, it was challenging to create a comprehensive list of ideas to increase membership. In hindsight, I would have delved into location data, as I had access to starting and ending latitudes and longitudes. With more time, I could have explored how geographic coordinates influenced rider behavior, such as whether casual riders were using electric bikes more frequently due to being outside of the city. Nonetheless, the data visualization provides valuable insights into rider behavior.</p>

								<h2 class="content">Insights into the Changing Landscape of Corporate America</h2>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="https://headlines.liu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Fortune500.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Back in early 2022, amidst the market turmoil, I found myself surrounded by brilliant minds in the financial services industry. One objection echoed through the room: "The S&P averages 10% a year, why do we need you!" Amidst the chaos, an analyst's remark struck a chord: "The S&P's stellar performance was skewed by the top 10 companies, while the rest underperformed." Inspired by that profound statement and fueled by curiosity, I couldn't shake the question: "After a year with 20% gains, could it truly be this skewed?" A year later, I delved into the exploration. </p>
								<p> In this project, I sought a historical perspective on top-performing companies as a starting point for analysis. Fortune 500 companies provided a suitable baseline for initial comparisons, even though they were not directly in the S&P 500. To accomplish this, I accessed a comprehensive dataset on Fortune 500 companies dating back to 1996 from Kaggle. </p>
								<p> The dataset contained over 30 columns of data, presenting the challenge of navigating through many empty cells and formatting inconsistencies. Notably, in 1996, company revenue was listed in traditional dollar format. However, as companies started earning billions and trillions, the formatting shifted to represent revenue in millions through a separate column. This observation raised concerns about inconsistency in the revenue data over the first 19 years.</p>
								<p> To ensure the reliability of my analysis, I decided to focus on revenue data from 2015 onwards. Given more time, I would further investigate the discrepancies and cross-reference with additional data sources to validate the information thoroughly. </p>
								<p> Through this meticulous approach, my goal was to lay a solid foundation for subsequent analyses and deliver precise insights into corporate performance trends. Alongside revenue, I thoroughly examined assets, employees, and profits for all companies post-2015. To achieve this, I executed a targeted query to extract the necessary data from the extensive dataset. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src=" https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQGXa6tTDTRHCQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1689269900739?e=1692835200&v=beta&t=vSct0Y-zs-BS3xa10d8Flv-mAxKdVgw-ba1eH89mQ7U" alt="" /></span>
								<p> In executing this query, I leveraged my SQL expertise in the CASE statement, Subqueries, Dense rank, aggregate functions, partitions, data manipulation through CAST, and advanced filtering. Although an alternative approach with a temp table and join was possible, I chose to practice running a subquery, further enhancing my skill set. </p>
								<p> After meticulous data cleaning using SQL, I uploaded the refined data to Tableau for effective data visualization. The primary objective was to gain insights into corporations and investigate potential disparities between the top 10 companies and the other 490. These findings will inform a subsequent project focusing on the S&P 500 and its constituent companies. </p>
								<p> With calculated fields, parameters, and filters, I designed a clean dashboard presenting key trends within the Fortune 500. My three major takeaways are as follows: 
									<p> 1.	Average Revenue Growth Disparity: The top 10 companies experienced significantly faster revenue growth compared to non-top 10 companies, with the gap expanding to a difference of 18x.</p>
									<p> 2.	Average Assets by Company: Top 10 companies demonstrated disproportionate asset growth compared to their Fortune 500 counterparts.</p>
									<p> 3.	Inconsistent Profitability: Top 10 Companies exhibited inconsistent profit growth, potentially due to a high percentage of tech companies within this group investing in Research and Development. Further analysis is required to pinpoint causations. </p>
								<p> In conclusion, this exploratory analysis addresses fundamental questions about the structure of the Fortune 500 and the distinctions between the top 10 companies and others. It serves as a valuable baseline for future investigations into the corporate landscape of America. I plan to explore additional questions, such as the probability of a top 10 company retaining its position in the following year and how the top 10 correlate with stock gains or losses for investors.</p>
